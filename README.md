## Hi there ðŸ‘‹

Iâ€™m a **Data Analyst** driven by curiosity to uncover the meaning behind data and turn it into actionable insight.

Iâ€™ve focused on developing my skills in data visualization, data modeling, and analytical problem-solving. I enjoy learning through hands-on work, experimentation, and sharing what I discover â€” which is why I created this space to document and exchange ideas.

Visit [my blog](tnhungct.github.io) if you want to discover more about me.
